            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non-profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen. Our state-of-the-art educational and training facility combines detailed technical video analysis with generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.</p>
            <p>We are an indoor training facility with 28 shooting lanes (14 ten-yard lanes and 14 twenty-yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26 additional twenty-yard lanes and an outdoor shooting field. We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from first-time archers to professional archers. Once set up with properly fitting equipment, each archer receives basic safety instruction and is introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>
            <p>From beginner to elite, archers of all ages and abilities learn about this exciting Olympic and international sport here. You can sign up for a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or corporate party, or compete in one of our many tournaments. We also offer homeschooling programs, kids' club events, YMCA classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement programs, and several other youth group activities. We are dedicated to teaching valuable life skills to the youth in our community through the wonderful discipline of archery.</p>
            <p>Our instructors are qualified Level 1 and Level 2 coaches who have met the safety requirements of USA Archery (USAA). We teach in a positive learning environment. Our instructors also have extensive knowledge of the most advanced archery equipment and all forms of archery, from the traditional longbow to the modern compound bow. We have specific instructors for recreational archery, competitive archery, and bow hunting.</p>
            <p>Straight to the Point Archery has excellent connections with USA Archery (USAA), Washington State Archery Association (WSAA), Washington State Bowhunters (WSB), National Field Archery Association (NFAA), and many more national and state archery associations. These partnerships allow you to feel confident in our facility and staff.</p>
            <p>Our staff has decades of experience in the archery industry. We are committed to educating and assisting with any questions you may have.</p>
